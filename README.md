## CDP CLI

The CDP command line interface (CLI) is [available from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cdpcli/). Instructions for installation are [available from CDP Management Console help documentation](https://docs.cloudera.com/management-console/cloud/cli/topics/mc-installing-cdp-client.html).

Once the CLI is installed, you can `import cdpcli` in your own Python code to use the CLI as a Python SDK. This mode of use is not yet fully supported, so be aware that the internal CLI code may change in the future.

## Documentation expansion in progress

Check back in the future for more documentation.
