# CDP Control Plane Public API Swagger Service Definitions

*Version: 0.9.37 (BETA)*

These service definitions files are the basis for official CDP API artifacts,
and you can use them to create your own client-side code. They adhere to the
[OpenAPI / Swagger 2.0](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) specification.

The service definitions make use of custom properties whose names are prefixed
with "x-". These properties are subject to change at any time. Do not rely upon
them to remain stable or compatible.

API requests must be signed according to the
[request signing specification](request_signing.md).
